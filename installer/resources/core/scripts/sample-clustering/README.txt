RTG Example Script For Visualizing Similarity Output
====================================================

Example R scripts to provide a simple interactive visualization of the
similarity of samples, based on the principal component analysis
output of the RTG similarity module.

These scripts are provided as an example intended to be modified to
suit your specific pipeline needs. Further instructions are contained
within each of the scripts.

similarity-simple.R  Visualize RTG similarity PCA output using sample labelling
similarity-kmeans.R  Visualize RTG similarity PCA using k-means clustering
similarity.pca       Example principal component analysis output from RTG similarity
