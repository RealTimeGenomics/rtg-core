RTG Example Reference File
==========================

These files illustrate how to specify a reference.txt file to allow
sex-specific mapping and variant calling. You may need to adjust the
chromosome names if you are using NCBI identifiers rather than chrNN
style. See the user manual for more information on reference.txt
specification and how to carry out sex-specific mapping and variant
calling.

hg18.example.reference.txt        An example reference.txt for hg18.
