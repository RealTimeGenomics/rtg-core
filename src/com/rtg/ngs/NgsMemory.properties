SUBSTITUTIONS_DESC=number of substitutions to search for
INDEL_DESC=number of indels to search for
INDELLEN_DESC=length of a single indel

PROGRAM_DESC = The "ngsmemory" module is used to determine the memory required for "ngsmap" search\n\nA simple invocation is:\n\n"slim ngsmemory -a substitutions -b indel -r readlength"\n\nwhere "substitutions" are number of substitutions to be guaranteed in the search, "indel" are number of insertion / deletion to be guaranteed and "readlength" is the length of reads to be mapped\n\nThis will print out the approximate memory required to map reads given the same input parameters.\n\nThe above command contains two output columns, first column indicates the word size that can be specified as input and second column indicates the number of bytes required to process individual read.
