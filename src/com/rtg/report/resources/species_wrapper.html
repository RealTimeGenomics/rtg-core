<h3>Metagenomic Community Profiling </h3>
        <p>
            RTG processes whole genome 'shotgun' metagenomic data by aligning reads to reference genomes
and uses RTG algorithms to compute genome coverage, species abundance, and community
composition. Three abundance estimates are reported:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Abundance of an individual genome/organism among the identified genomes. Provides a
relative 'count' on a per microbe basis.</li>
<li> Abundance of a particular genome or species normalized by DNA sequence size.</li>
<li> Abundance of a particular genome or species in a sample, taking into account both mapped
and unmapped reads.</li>
        </ul>
